# Issue: Dark Reader Not Inverting Colors in Bing Chat

## Problem Description
**Issue Link:** [GitHub Issue #11496](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/issues/11496)

The Dark Reader plugin I am using in Microsoft Edge is not functioning correctly when applied to Bing Chat. Specifically, the main chat area is experiencing issues with color inversion. Instead of the expected white text on a dark background, the chat text containers have black text on a dark background. It appears that the CSS property responsible for inverting colors is not being applied correctly to these elements. There may be an obstacle preventing the expected color inversion.

## Goal
My objective is to ensure that the colors are inverted correctly in Bing Chat, with white text on a dark background, as intended by the Dark Reader plugin.

## Working Solutions Explored
I have explored the following solutions to address this issue:

### [[$Solution 1 - Dark Reader Issue]]

### [[$Solution 2 - Dark Reader Issue]]
